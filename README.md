# Grading-Application
- This grading application is created using Python programming language. 
- The application allows you to add student names and prompts you to add three more names. 
- For each student, you can insert grades for their first homework and tests using a 100 point grading scale.

- Once all grades are entered, the program will calculate a range and display the grades that each student received on an A-F grading scale, based on the inputs provided by the user.
